The main objective of the proposed system is to increase the efficiency and the effectiveness of SE processes by reducing the manual works that done by the college staff. The proposed system will increase the productivity by allowing the job to be done quickly. Compilation of data can be done easily with just a click of mouse and fewer parties are involved which greatly reduce the man power. 
Either is the traditional feedback method or the new using Google form to collect the feedback, what does this system do is to provide much more beneficial functions compared to forms and enable data integrity and security of the sensitive data gathered from being exposed outside. 
Retrieval of the data can be done faster because the records are stored and well-organized in the database. The filter between the tables in the database allow the user to perform searching easier unlike the Excel spreadsheets in which the retrieval of data is difficult as searching of records must be done in each individual spreadsheet as they are not related to each other and plus for statistics a better charts has in built to review much more easier and evaluate efficiently reducing extra workload
